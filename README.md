# python-challenge

There are 2 Python challenges in this assignment, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

Setup:

There is a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 

There is a folder for each Python assignment, PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder, there is a file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

There is also a Resources folder that contains the CSV files for analysis.

There is also an Analysis folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.

Specific PyBank instructions:

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Specific PyPoll instructions:

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
